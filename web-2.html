        <h1>Foods</h1>
        <h2>Food is any substance consumed by an organism for nutritional support. Food is usually of plant, animal, or fungal
            origin and contains essential nutrients such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, or minerals.</h2>
        <p><b>The substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by the organism's cells to provide energy, maintain life,
                or
                stimulate growth. Different species of animals have different feeding behaviours that satisfy the needs of their
                metabolisms and have evolved to fill a specific ecological niche within specific geographical
                contexts.</b>Omnivorous humans are highly adaptable and have adapted to obtaining food in many different
            ecosystems. Humans generally
            use cooking to prepare food for consumption. The majority of the food energy required is supplied by the industrial
            food
            industry, which produces food through intensive agriculture and distributes it through complex food processing and
            food
            distribution systems. This system of conventional agriculture relies heavily on fossil fuels, which means that the
            food
            and agricultural systems are one of the major contributors to climate change, accounting for as much as 37% of total
            greenhouse gas emissions.[1]
        
            The food system has a significant impact on a wide range of other social and political issues, including
            sustainability,
            biological diversity, economics, population growth, water supply, and food security. Food safety and security are
            monitored by international agencies, like the International Association for Food Protection, the World Resources
            Institute, the World Food Programme, the Food and Agriculture Organization, and the International Food Information
            Council.</p>

        <h2>Different cuisines</h2>
        <p>Cuisine refers to the style of cooking and the dishes that are characteristic of a specific culture, region, or country.
        It encompasses the unique ingredients, techniques, and traditions associated with food preparation in a particular area.
        Essentially, it's how a culture expresses itself through food.</p>
        <h5><b>Some names of cuisines and paragraph about them is given below:</b></h5>
        <section id="pizza">
            <h3>Pizza</h3>
            <p>Pizza is a dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round, flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with
                tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients (such as anchovies, olives, meat, etc.), which is then baked
                at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.</p>

            <h3>Sushi</h3>
            <p><b>Sushi is a traditional Japanese dish consisting of vinegared rice combined with various ingredients, such as seafood,</b>
                vegetables, and occasionally tropical fruits. It is often served with soy sauce, wasabi, and pickled ginger.</p>
            <p>Here's a more detailed look at sushi:
            Rice:
            The foundation of sushi is specially prepared rice called "shari" or "sumeshi", which is seasoned with vinegar, sugar,
            and salt.
            Fillings and Toppings:
            Sushi can be filled or topped with a wide range of ingredients, including raw or cooked fish, vegetables like cucumber
            or avocado, and even egg (tamago).
            Types of Sushi:
            There are various forms of sushi, including:
            <b>Nigiri:</b>
            Hand-formed rice topped with a piece of fish or other topping.
            <b>Maki:</b>
            Rice and fillings rolled in seaweed (nori) and cut into slices.
            <b>Temaki:</b>
            Hand-rolled cones of nori filled with rice and various ingredients.
            <b>Chirashizushi:</b>
            A bowl of sushi rice topped with a variety of ingredients.
            </p>
            <p>Historical Context:
            Sushi's origins trace back to Southeast Asia as a method of preserving fish in salt and fermented rice. It later evolved
            in Japan, with the rice becoming a part of the dish rather than being discarded.</p>

            <p><b>A hamburger is a sandwich consisting of one or more cooked patties of ground meat, usually beef, placed inside a sliced
            bread roll or bun. The patty may be pan-fried, grilled, smoked, or flame-broiled. It is often served with lettuce,
            tomato, onion, pickles, cheese, and condiments such as mustard, mayonnaise, ketchup, or relish.</b></p>

            <p><b>Pasta is a staple food of Italian origin made from wheat flour and water, formed into various shapes and typically
                cooked by boiling. It is often served with a variety of sauces, vegetables, and meats.</b></p>

        <section id="Salad">
            <h3>Salad</h3>
            <p><b>A salad is a dish consisting of a mixture of small pieces of food, usually vegetables or fruit. It can be served
                cold or warm and is often dressed with oil, vinegar, or other dressings.</b></p>
            <p>Garden salads have a base of raw leafy greens (sometimes young "baby" greens) such as lettuce, arugula (rocket), kale or
            spinach; they are common enough that the word salad alone often refers specifically to garden salads. Other types of
            salad include bean salad, tuna salad, bread salads (such as fattoush, panzanella), vegetable salads without leafy greens
            (such as Greek salad, potato salad, coleslaw), rice-, pasta- and noodle-based salads, fruit salads and dessert salads.
            
            Salads may be served at any point during a meal:
            
            Appetizer salads – light, smaller-portion salads served as the first course of the meal
            Side salads – to accompany the main course as a side dish; examples include potato salad and coleslaw
            Main course salads – usually containing a portion of one or more high-protein foods, such as eggs, legumes, or cheese
            Dessert salads – sweet salads containing fruit, gelatin, sweeteners or whipped cream
            When a sauce is used to flavor a salad, it is generally called a dressing; most salad dressings are based on either a
            mixture of oil and vinegar or a creamy dairy base.</p>
